#### 4. View full task content
Sometimes, the task you created may be a long text or paragraphy but you are unable to have a full view of it at the main page, you can just tap on the task to view the full content.

#### 5. Search
As time flows, more and more tasks will be created and you will find it hard to look for the task you created, you can simply just type in any keyword on the searchbar to look for it.
